\chapter{Visualization}

The data was received in a \textit{.csv} file, and it contains the following columns:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{accountid} - customer account id
	\item \textit{amount} - amount of bought products
	\item \textit{closedate} - date in which the deal was closed
	\item \textit{opportunityid} - lead id
	\item \textit{opportunity\_creation\_date\_\_c} - date in which the first contact with the customer was made
	\item \textit{ownerid} - seller id (the \textit{owner} of the opportunity)
	\item \textit{primary\_application\_\_c} - primary application of the product that is being sold
	\item \textit{stagename} - in which stage the sale is categorized
	\item \textit{sales\_team\_\_c} - to which sales team the opportunity, seller, and customer belongs
\end{itemize}

The description of the columns are based solely on the name of the columns itself. In an ideal environment I would get a more accurate definition of each one by asking the person that sent me the file a description of each column, and proceed with the analysis to avoid mistakes and misinterpretations.
