# Step_3 - Final

This project uses Python and SQL to create a Business Intelligence Report.

* Folder **01 - python viz** contains the Python code that was used to generate the images that can be seen in the final report.
* Folder **02 - database** contains the SQL code that was used to create and populate the database. Some extra code in Python can also be found there because it was used to create some dummy data.
* Folder **report** contains the final report, written in LaTeX.
